# basic-tool

forked from [ahmetkotan](https://github.com/zerosquadron/basic-tools.git)...

forked to update deprecated method in cpBitmapToPng.py, a converter for Apple's cpbitmap format to png using Python and PIL. You'll also need to put cImage.py in your active python version ( > python 3.x )

whomever downloads/clones/uses these scripts assumes responsibility for whatever may happen... I forked this from someone else, afterall! ;)
